                <p>I am a student in the <em>Interactive Media Design</em> program at Algonquin College. This will be my 1<sup>st</sup> year at a College. I chose the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program because it offers a lot of possibilities.</p>
                <p>I enjoy taking photographs, drawing and taking videos. I have one dog named Max and a lot of goldfish.</p>
